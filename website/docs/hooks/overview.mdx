<PackageBadges package="@weser/hooks" />

## Installation

<Callout title="Required dependencies">
  This package relies on [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)
  and thus requires version 16.3 or higher.
</Callout>

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/hooks

# yarn
yarn add @weser/hooks

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/hooks
```

## Motivation

[Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) are the standard way to manage state and side effects in React.<br />
There are many great libraries out there that provide a lot of useful hooks for common use cases, but I found myself creating a lot of custom hooks for my own use cases anyways.<br />
That's why I decided to create this package.

## Benefits

As with every hooks collection, you get a bunch of useful hooks for common use cases that can reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write, save you some time and improve the readability of your code.
