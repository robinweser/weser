A package for working with [Zod](https://zod.dev) and [JSON Schemas](https://json-schema.org).<br />
It ships many small helpers for a schema-first approach to building user interfaces.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/schema" />

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/schema

# yarn
yarn add @weser/schema

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/schema
```

## Motivation

Schema validation is a core part of any modern, type-safe application.
With Zod as a popular and powerful library, we can do all sorts of things from API requests to form validation.<br />
However, since everything is stored as objects and functions, we can't really store them in a database or iterate over them in a more straight forward way.
That's where this package comes in. It ships a set of helpers for converting Zod schemas to JSON Schemas and vice versa for full end-to-end type safety.

## Benefits

Being able to turn complex Zod schemas into JSON Schemas comes with two main benefits:

1. Being able to store the schema in a database
2. Being able to iterate over the schema in a more straight forward way

This allows for a schema-first approach where the schema is the single source of truth and the UI is generated based on it.
