A tiny, tree-shakable alternative to [color](https://github.com/Qix-/color).<br />
It is very limited and optimized for runtime usage in the browser.<br />
It only supports a subset of color and does not have input validation.<br />

It has zero dependencies and supports tree-shaking making its size even smaller depending on the functions used.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/colors" />

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/colors

# yarn
yarn add @weser/colors

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/colors
```

## Motivation

tbd.

## Benefits

tbd.

## Limitations

1. It only supports valid CSS color string to be passed in
2. It currently only supports rgb(a) and hsl(a) color values
3. It does not optimize output values (e.g. round decimals to X digits)
4. It does not validate input values
5. It always returns `hsla` or `rgba` (even if alpha=1)
