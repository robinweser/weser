A simple helper to create and render keyframes on on-demand.<br />
It (optionally) utilizes React's new [style hoisting feature](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/style#rendering-an-inline-css-stylesheet) when available.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/keyframes" />

## Installation

<Callout title="Note">
  Style hoisting requires a canary version of React. Install via `react@canary`.
</Callout>

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/keyframes

# yarn
yarn add @weser/keyframes

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/keyframes
```

## Motivation

When working with [inline styles](/styling/overview) or CSS-in-JS libraries, there often is no built-in way to do animations properly.
Therefore, I created this small utility to create keyframes on-demand without having to write and handle CSS files.

## Benefits

It allows you to create both single keyframes as well as keyframe dictionaries on-demand.
