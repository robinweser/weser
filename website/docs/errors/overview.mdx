A simple utility for handling errors in a more ergonomic way.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/errors" />

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/errors

# yarn
yarn add @weser/errors

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/layers
```

## Motivation

I use the [invariant](/errors/api/invariant) pattern a lot in my code and thus I wanted to quickly publish it somewhere.<br />
Nothing fancy and probably available in other packages as well.<br />
I might add more helpers in the future.
