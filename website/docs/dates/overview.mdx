A tiny date formatting library with built-in i18n support.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/dates" />

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/dates

# yarn
yarn add @weser/dates

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/dates
```

## Motivation

There are several date formatting libraries out there. It all started with [Moment](https://momentjs.com), while nowadays smaller alternatives such as [date-fns](https://date-fns.org), [DayJS](https://day.js.org) and [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) among others are raising in popularity.<br />
While [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) already comes in a really small format, it was still way to big for my most common use case: Format a date with a given pattern.<br />
So I created this tiny library as an attempt to solve this specific problem with as little bytes as possible.

## How it works

I was using [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) previously and really liked it. So I had the idea to use that under the hood while providing a nice API that accepts a pattern in a widely used format.<br />
The nice thing about [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) is that it has built-in i18n support.

## Benefits

tbd.

## Limitations

1. It only supports valid CSS color string to be passed in
2. It currently only supports rgb(a) and hsl(a) color values
3. It does not optimize output values (e.g. round decimals to X digits)
4. It does not validate input values
5. It always returns `hsla` or `rgba` (even if alpha=1)
