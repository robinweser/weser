A tiny date formatting library with built-in i18n support.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/dates" />

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/dates

# yarn
yarn add @weser/dates

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/dates
```

## Motivation

There are several date formatting libraries out there. It all started with [Moment](https://momentjs.com), while nowadays smaller alternatives such as [date-fns](https://date-fns.org), [DayJS](https://day.js.org) and [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) among others are raising in popularity.<br />
While [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) already comes in a really small format, it was still way to big for my most common use case: Format a date with a given pattern.<br />
So I created this tiny library as an attempt to solve this specific problem with as little bytes as possible.

## How It works

I was using [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) previously and really liked it. So I had the idea to use that under the hood while providing a nice API that accepts a pattern in a widely used format.<br />
The nice thing about [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) is that it has built-in i18n support.
