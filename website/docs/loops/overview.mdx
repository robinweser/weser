A collection of small, typescript-friendly, performant & immutable iteration utilities for arrays and objects.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/loops" />

## Installation

<Callout title="Required dependencies">
  This package relies on [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)
  and thus requires version 16.3 or higher.
</Callout>

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/loops

# yarn
yarn add @weser/loops

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/actions
```

## Motivation

Because JavaScript's native "functional" APIs such as `forEach`, `reduce`, `map` and `filter` are slow. There're many different utility packages out there already, e.g. lodash. But lodash's `reduce` method itself is 4.5kb gzipped which is way too much for a simple Array/Object reduce utility.

## Benefits
